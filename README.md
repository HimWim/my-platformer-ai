# **Project Overview**  

This project aims to develop an AI model that learns to play a **customized 2D game** through reinforcement learning. The AI model will be trained to navigate the game environment, learn from its interactions, and improve its performance over time.

## **Game Details**  

- A **2D game** built using **Pygame**.  
- The environment is designed to challenge the AI player as it learns to complete objectives.  
- The AI will interact with the game world, analyze the environment, and improve its skills through repeated gameplay.

## **AI Model**  

- The AI is based on **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**.  
- It uses the **Gym library** to simulate and train in the game environment.  
- The model continuously learns from rewards and penalties to optimize gameplay strategies.

## **Project Goals**  

- Implement **reinforcement learning** to train an AI agent.  
- Allow the AI to **self-learn** by interacting with the game environment.  
- Improve AI performance over time using **trial-and-error learning**.
